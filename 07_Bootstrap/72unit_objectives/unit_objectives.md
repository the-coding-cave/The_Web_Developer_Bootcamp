#####Note
[Bootstrap v.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)
 Ensure that you're using version 3.3.7 in your code as you're following along with the lectures.
 Colt teaches version 3 in this section and version 4 in the next.

**Why teach both versions?**
Many companies still use version 3, so if you know both versions then you can easily help them migrate to version 4. Also, the YelpCamp project in the back-end section of this course uses version 3, so if you don't know the version 3 syntax it will be more difficult to follow along.
