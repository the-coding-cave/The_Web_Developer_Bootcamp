    <h1>Login Form</h1>
    <!--Form: essentially a container for inputs-->
    <!-- Action: Where the form sends data to-->
    <!-- Method: What HTTP method (get or post)-->
    <form action = "redirect.html" method = "GET">
        <input name = "username"type="text" placeholder="username">
        <input name = "password"type="password" placeholder="password">
        <input type="submit">
    </form>

    <!-- Notes: 
        * If you don't specify an action, the page refreshes, 
          The data is not being submitted else where. It sends a 
          request plus data to the current page
        * So we could redirect and send data to another html doc. 
          Later we will be sending data to our own servers/backend
        * To summarize, when we type data into a form, and click submit, 
          the data is taken out of the form and the request is sent
          somewhere. 
        * Note the url and the query once you hit submit. You can 
          see the data-->
