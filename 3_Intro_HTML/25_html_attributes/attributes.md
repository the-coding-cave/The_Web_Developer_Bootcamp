Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

* All HTML elements can have attributes
* Attributes provide additional information about an element
* Attributes are always specified in the start tag
* Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

For example: Anchor tag with href attribute
< a href = "url"> Link Text </ a>

The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. If the href attribute is not present, the tag is not a hyperlink. href stands for Hypertext REFerence. It is the attribute of the html which gives the URL of the page the link goes to.
